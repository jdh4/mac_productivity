# Keyboard Remappings

In this section, we will install and configure free software to remap keys, create complex shortcuts, and change keyboard behavior.

## Step 1: Install

Install [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org) on your machine.

The software needs input monitoring permissions to capture and modify keystrokes. You will need to make multiple changes to your systems settings. Follow the directions while installing the software.

## Step 2: Configure the Meta Key

The [caps lock] key is large and accessible but useless to most users. We will configure our keyboard so that when the caps lock key is held, other keys have a different meaning.
