# Clipboard Manager

Until recently Mac allowed for one item in the clipboard ([Ctrl] + [C]). The latest version of Spotlight improved on this but it is still limited. Here we will use Raycast as our clipboard manager.

If you need a more powerful clipboard manager than what Raycast provides then see [Paste](https://pasteapp.io) ($29.99/year). Also, look at [Setapp](https://setapp.com) which is a subscription to a few hundred potentialy useful Mac apps.
