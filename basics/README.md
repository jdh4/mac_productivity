## Add Frequently Used Folders to Sidebar

Click on a folder icon and drag it JUST BENEATH the bottom item in the sidebar:

The `winter_2026` folder is now easly accessible:

**Exercise**: Add one of your frequently used folders to the sidebar.

Later we will see how Raycast Quicklinks can also be used to quickly open a Finder window for a specific folder.

## Repeat Rates

Apple > System Settings > Keyboard

Use the fastest "Key repeat rate" that you are comfortable with. Use a small "Delay until repeat".

## Tap to Click

Apple > System Settings > Trackpad

Instead of pressing down on the trackpad to click, consider tapping lightly:

## Default Location of Finder

You can specify which folder Finder is showing when it is launched:

Finder > Settings > General > "New finder window to show"

Good choices are your home directory, Recents, or Desktop.

## Remove Items from the Sidebar

Finder > Settings > General > Sidebar

Uncheck any items that you do not use (e.g., Documents, Movies, Music). This will make it easier to spot the useful items.

## Clean the Finder Toolbar

View > "Customize Toolbar..."

Drag items off the toolbar that you have not used. Drag items to the toolbar that you should use. When in doubt, leave items off the toolbar to make it easier to spot the useful items.

## List vs. Column View

Column view is good for navigation. List view is good for searching by name or date. To use list view <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd>. For column view <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd>. You can set the default view of a given folder (set the view of choice then View > Show View Options and make sure "Always Open in list/column view is checked. This happens on a per directory basis as indicated by the name of the folder at the top of the window.
